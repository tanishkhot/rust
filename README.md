# Rust 

This repository documents my progress as I learn Rust, focusing on concepts relevant to building high-performance, secure backend systems. Each folder within this repository is a standalone project or concept.

## Projects

* **[hello_world](./hello_world/)**: A simple "Hello, World!" program to verify the Rust toolchain and basic Cargo commands.

## Overall Prerequisites

To run any of the projects in this repository, you will need the Rust toolchain installed on your system.
* **Install Rust:** Follow the official instructions at [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
