# Project: Hello, World!

This is a minimal Rust application that prints "Hello, world!" to the console.

Its purpose is to serve as a basic test of the Rust installation and an introduction to the `cargo` build system.

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have the Rust toolchain installed ([link](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)).
2.  From within this directory (`/hello_world`), run the following command:

    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```
